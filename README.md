# BeginnerPython
A repository of short programs that showcase my learning path of Python. I'll be working my way through 
Learn Python 3 The Hard Way and also Learn More Python 3 The Hard Way. The books are full of examples and
activities that highlight different areas of Python 3. However, I'll only be showcasing my own original versions
of Python programs to demonstrate my knowledge of the language.
