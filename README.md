# BeginnerPython
A repository of short programs that showcase my learning path of Python. I'll be running through Real Python's book and tutorials. 
The book is full of examples and activities that highlight different areas of Python 3. However, I'll only be showcasing my own 
original versions of Python programs to demonstrate my knowledge of the language.
